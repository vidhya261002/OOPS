# Manufacturing Process Optimization Tool

**A tool to model, analyze, and optimize the manufacturing process for heavy equipment.**

Key Features:\
  • Model the entire manufacturing workflow.\
  • Analyze and optimize process efficiency.\
  • Simulate process changes and measure their impact on production time.

OOP Concepts Used:\
  • Encapsulation: Classes like Process, Step, and Equipment encapsulate related attributes and behaviors.\
  • Inheritance: Extend Equipment into specific types such as WeldingMachine and PaintBooth.\
  • Polymorphism: Use different optimization strategies for different equipment types.

Possible Extensions:\
  • Integrate real-time data from manufacturing sensors.\
  • Add AI-based decision-making for process improvements.
